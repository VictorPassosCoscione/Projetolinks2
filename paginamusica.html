    <h1>Oi, aqui esta uma musica que eu gosto.</h1>
    <br>
    <h4>Young and beautiful "Lana del rey"</h4>
    <audio src="young.mp3" controls="controls"></audio>

    <p>I've seen the world, done it all, had my cake now <br>
        Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel Air now <br>
        Hot summer nights, mid-July <br>
        When you and I were forever wild <br>
        The crazy days, city lights
        The way you'd play with me like a child <br>
        Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful? <br>
        Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul? <br>
        I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will <br>
        Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful? <br>
        I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now <br>
        Channeling angels in the new age now <br>
        Hot summer days, rock and roll <br>
        The way you'd play for me at your show <br>
        And all the ways I got to know <br>
        Your pretty face and electric soul <br>
        Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful? <br>
        Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul? <br>
        I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will  <br>
        Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful? <br>
        Dear Lord, when I get to Heaven <br>
        Please let me bring my man <br>
        When he comes, tell me that you'll let him in <br>
        Father, tell me if you can <br>
        All that grace, all that body <br>
        All that face makes me wanna party <br>
        He's my sun, he makes me shine like diamonds <br>
        Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful? <br>
        Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul? <br>
        I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will <br>
        Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful? <br>
        Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?</p>
